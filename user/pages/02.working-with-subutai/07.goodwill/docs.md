### <a name="overview"> </a> GoodWill: An Overview

#### What is it?

GoodWill is the exchange currency of the Subutai Peer-to-Peer platform that enables users to buy and sell compute resources from each other. GoodWill is a pure utility token with a fixed price relative to the US dollar (100 GoodWill = 1 US Dollar). Essentially, one GoodWill on the Subutai Platform represents a virtualized US penny. By using GoodWill to exchange resources participants can fluidly trade computing resources across national borders without having to rely on the exchange of cumbersome fiat currencies.
