One-click cloud application installation is critical. People from all walks of life should be able to launch an application in their own P2P cloud instantly. It should be as easy as installing an iPhone application from the Apple App Store. Bridging this gap between non-technical users and open source products is crucial for the success of open source in the cloud era. Subutai Blueprints make cloud applications easy to install and use for mass consumption. They do so by combining the downloading, installation and configuration of applications in a single process.

Subutai Blueprints specify general instructions for installing, updating
and maintaining P2P distributed cloud applications. The Subutai P2P
Cloud combines these instructions with load and resource availability
information to optimally place infrastructure resources in P2P cloud
environments and run distributed applications. P2P orchestration can
occur perpetually to adapt to shifting conditions to keep applications
running.

### Why use Blueprints

- Reduce system administration overheads
- Simplify process of distributed application deployment
- Click-and-go simplicity: instantly build a P2P cloud environment
- Choose from dozens of Blueprints available to Bazaar users: new additions weekly

#### The Fight for Freedom


The OS wars are over, yet the battle for user freedom and privacy has
shifted to the cloud, and nefarious actors continue to infringe on these
inalienable rights. The outcome of the fight depends on the ability of
the masses to easily host open source applications in their own cloud
without needing a technical background.

Subutai was created to allow anyone with computer resources to share or
rent them with others and securely host their cloud applications any way
they like, but Subutai alone is not enough. Application blueprints that
insulate users from technical details, and allow for one click
application installation with zero maintenance overhead are needed.

#### Warriors and Weapons

Blueprint authors are open source warriors (Baatyr in Mongolian) in the
battle for freedom, choice, and privacy in the cloud era. Subutai has
provided its warriors with the most powerful weapon of all, a P2P Cloud
Computing and Internet of Things Platform to deliver their applications
to the masses.

#### Helping Allies Win

The platform supports Open Source Projects to gain more users that would
never have used their product, and that could make all the difference
for them to prosper. It brings users closer to the communities that
provide FOSS products. See the [Open Source Contribution
Program](https://subutai.io/helping-the-good-guys.html) for more
details on how Subutai provides direct resource assistance to Open
Source Projects. Besides spreading a lot of “good will” and helping Open
Source, blueprint authors in turn get Subutai™
GoodWill](https://subutai.io/goodwill.html) when they host their blueprints on the [Subutai Bazaar](https://bazaar.subutai.io).
