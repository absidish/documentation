Subutai Blueprints specify general instructions for installing, updating
and maintaining P2P distributed cloud applications into [Subutai
Environments](../glossary/#environment). The Subutai P2P
Cloud combines these instructions with load and resource availability
information to optimally place infrastructure resources in P2P cloud
environments and run distributed applications. Blueprints can be published by authors on the [Subutai Bazaar](https://bazaar.subutai.io). The Bazaar is a marketplace for Subutai Products and Peers.

#### Helping Allies Win
