<!--[Subutai Bazaar](https://bazaar.subutai.io) is the P2P cloud market and social environment for the
Subutai Platform. These documentation pages have instructions on what it
can do and how. Through the Bazaar users can sell, barter, share or hire
computational resources and server applications from other users.
 The Bazaar congregates Peers provided by the community of users running
Subutai PeerOS. Anyone can create Environments on these Peers, based on
diverse templates that range from simple containerized linux servers to
more complex applications such as Cassandra, Apache, Wordpress, Jetty or
even a full-fledged GNU-Linux Operating System with a Graphic User
Interface.
###Sign up
Sign up to the Bazaar by accessing the [register page](https://bazaar.subutai.io/register). You can either inform your e-mail and click "Sign up", or choose one of the options of external authentication (Facebook, Google or GitHub).
