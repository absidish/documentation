##OptDyn™ Announces Subutai™ Blockchain-in-a-Box for Solidity Smart Contracts {.postTitle-page}

**First free, turnkey “Blockchain as a Service” (BaaS) blueprint provides instant environment for writing decentralized blockchain-based applications on Ethereum Network**

===

**New Castle, DE —13 March 2018—** OptDyn™, makers of Subutai™, the world’s first intelligent Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Cloud computing platform, today announced the immediate availability of the Subutai Blockchain-in-a-Box blueprint.

Software blueprints act as templates to reduce development time and help simplify the process of application deployment. Subutai blueprints specify general instructions to automate P2P distributed application management tasks: i.e. installing, updating and maintaining applications.

### Subutai Blockchain-in-a-Box {.subTitleImg}

Blockchain-in-a-Box creates an all-inclusive developer environment for writing Smart Contracts and testing them on a private Ethereum network. This provides a free, instant environment for Solidity (the programming language used for writing Smart Contracts) developers.

“One of the most attractive Subutai application blueprints is our just-released Blockchain-in-a-Box, which enables developers to write Smart Contracts in minutes without having to deal with obtaining testnet Ether (the cryptocurrency fueling the Ethereum network),” said Alex Karasulu, CTO and Founder of OptDyn. “Subutai goes beyond the promise of Blockchain as a Service (BaaS) by setting up the private network along with an entire desktop system in
the same cloud environment with a full Solidity development stack to author and test Smart Contracts.”

**Reduced time to Deployment**

Blockchain-in-a-Box eliminates the need to deal with infrastructure administration, version compatibility, and all the other tedious aspects of configuring a blockchain network thereby reducing the time to develop and deploy Ethereum Dapps. The blueprint may use one of the Ethereum test networks (allows Ethereum Solidity developers to experiment with new code and solutions) or an entirely private dedicated blockchain. All that is required to use the environment is a basic knowledge of JavaScript and Solidity: Blockchain-in-a-Box creates a self-contained cloud development environment with a remote desktop and a private blockchain network to allow users to build and deploy smart contracts, transact, and more.

In addition to Blockchain-in-a-Box, Subutai offers blueprints for popular applications such as Wordpress (content management and blogging platform) and Mattermost (private cloud messaging), as well as development frameworks such as Apache Usergrid (used for mobile development). Subutai blueprints make it easy for users to quickly get up and running.

**Conquer the Cloud!**

Getting started with Blockchain-in-a-Box is easy: the documentation, which includes tutorials on writing contracts, can be found at [docs.subutai.io/Blueprints/blockchain-in-a-box/Introduction](https://docs.subutai.io/Blueprints/blockchain-in-a-box/Introduction.html).

**Availability**

Subutai Blockchain-in-a-Box is available in the Subutai Bazaar at [bazaar.subutai.io](https://bazaar.subutai.io/) (registration required). As with all Subutai blueprints, Blockchain-in-a-Box is Open Source software, released under Apache License v2.0.
