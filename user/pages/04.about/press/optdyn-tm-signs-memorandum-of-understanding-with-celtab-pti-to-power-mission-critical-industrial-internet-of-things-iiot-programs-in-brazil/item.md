##OptDyn™ Signs Memorandum of Understanding with Celtab/PTI to power Mission-Critical Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) programs in Brazil {.postTitle-page}

**Subutai™ Peer-to-Peer Cloud Computing Platform drives Industry 4.0 opportunities, from manufacturing to smart cities to energy management and beyond.**

===

**Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil —3 May 2018 -** OptDyn™, makers of Subutai™, the world’s first intelligent Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Cloud computing platform, announced today that it has signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with Celtab/PTI.

Celtab is one of the research centers of Brazil’s Itaipu Technological Park, the foundation responsible for promoting scientific, technological, and innovation development linked to Itaipu Binacional, the largest clean energy generator in the world. Celtab performs open software research aiming at innovation and the generation of solutions to meet Itaipu's needs.

The MoU advances Itaipu’s strategy to stimulate rapid expansion of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) and Industry 4.0 initiatives in Brazil using OptDyn’s Subutai Peer-to-Peer Cloud Computing Platform.

"Subutai moves the 'Things' from the Internet of Things into the cloud, allowing more control of where the processing of the data is performed," said Jon “maddog” Hall, CEO of OptDyn. "Setting up a local peer-to-peer cloud allows data latencies to be lower, and lowers the amount of data transfer from the 'Things' to a secure initial processing and filtering point. I have known and worked with PTI for many years and it pleases me to be working with them in my official capacity as CEO of OptDyn, Inc."

Industry 4.0 utilizes IIoT to increase automation and productivity, and dramatically reduce costs by using real-time data across systems that are self-optimizing, self-configuring, and responsive to communications, analytics, and insights. Numerous sectors, including utilities, smart factories and manufacturing, supply chain management, government and social services, energy management, and more benefit from Industry 4.0 process and infrastructure efficiencies. KPMG estimates that the component markets of Industry 4.0 will be worth more than US$4T by 2020, and Accenture projects that IIoT could add $14.2T to the economy by 2020.

"Jon 'maddog' is one of the world's benchmarks in free software. He's always here for the Latinoware (Latin America Free Software Conference)," said PTI Technical Director, Claudio Issamy Osako, when signing the MoU. "What interests us is the American entrepreneurship logic. From OptDyn, mainly, we expect to transform business starting from open technologies. And this MoU will give us the possibility to apply a hardware and software technology to develop solutions in many areas. The key is not the technology itself, but the results that will come from it. If you develop real solutions for real problems, you develop a market, entrepreneurships, companies...from this MoU, we'll optimize the IoT projects and that's huge for us."

"This MoU comes to reinforce a series of actions from Celtab," said Professor Miguel Matrakas, manager of Celtab/PTI, who was also present at the MoU signing. "We’ve been working with IoT, we have a lab for this subject and the Blockchain Router they're offering, which will be on the market in a few months, also works on this theme. With that in mind, we also consider the target audience: private individuals, for those who want some kind of automation level in their homes and also to look for partners, in an endowment exchange. So, who has a low use computer may offer computing services and transform idle machines into a personal income tool."

Both Subutai's Open Source P2P Cloud Computing software and the industrial edition of the Subutai Blockchain Router v2.0 provide crucial information exchange and security infrastructure for mission-critical IIoT and Industry 4.0 applications. Subutai's adaptability means that peers  don’t have to be limited to actual computers or consumer edge devices. With Subutai, peers can also be part of IIoT, and are able to meet a number of stringent requirements such as unfailing control, security, reliability in extreme environments, and the ability to operate with little or no human intervention.

The Subutai Blockchain Router v2.0 is a broadband Cloud router and open hardware IoT gateway. The router comes preinstalled with Subutai PeerOS tuned and hardware accelerated, and offers advanced P2P cloud router and IoT gateway functions using the world’s most powerful SoC (system-on-chip), the Xilinx® Zynq UltraScale+™ MPSoC, packed with four 64-bit cores with up to 16GB of DDR4 RAM capacity.

The Subutai Blockchain Router's industrial configuration is designed for mission-critical IoT applications, and uses higher grade temperature resistant chips that operate between -40°C and 100°C. The programmable logic is dedicated to critical IoT security operations. The Blockchain Router’s hardware-based IoT security subsystem, combined with its interoperability with PMOD, Arduino, and Raspberry Pi shields has brought it to the forefront of Brazil's national IoT standards as the high-end IoT gateway of the Caninos Loucos project. Using just 18-watts, the Subutai Blockchain Router is eco-friendly and cost-effective —a critically important consideration in today's energy-aware environment.

Highly adaptive, the Blockchain Router's security and performance-accelerated firmware dynamically changes its configuration and implements mechanisms in response to intrusion detection, usage behavior, and any potential threats encountered. In March 2018, the Subutai Blockchain Router entered production in partnership with LSI-TEC (Laboratório de Sistemas Integráveis Tecnológico) in São Paulo, Brazil. Dr. Matrakas recently stated that "the Subutai Blockchain Router v2.0 and its industrial configuration provide the crucial hardware security infrastructure needed for IoT applications in the utility sector."

The MoU signing took place at Itaipu Technological Park in Foz do Iguaçu, Brazil.

**About Celtab/PTI - Latin American Center for Open Technologies**

Open technologies are a powerful Research and Development Tool and potential generator of solutions for the needs of Itaipu Binacional, as well as input for the formation of new enterprises. The free software research is done at the Latin American Center for Open Technologies (Celtab) aiming at innovation. The knowledge of the Center is widespread through partnerships with public, private, academic research, promotion and production institutes. In 2016, Celtab formalized a cooperation deal with Linux Professional Institute – LPI, for the development of actions in the region that promote the training of professionals in open source technologies.

The initial phase of this partnership seeks to identify, among the region's high schools, institutions seeking to qualify for the Linux Essentials certification, the first one of the professional career. All the qualification process must be associated with an entrepreneurial project, in which the student get to know one or more products in free software that can make up his or her service offer for the region in which he or she is inserted. In the higher education institutions, the goal is to introduce topics of the LPI Certifications, promoting the participation of these students in the offered certifications.
