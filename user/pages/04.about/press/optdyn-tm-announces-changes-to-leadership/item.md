**New Castle, DE — 10 July 2018 —** OptDyn™, makers of Subutai™, the world’s first intelligent blockchain-driven, Peer-to-Peer Cloud and IoT computing platform, announced today the following leadership changes:

* Sally Khudairi will be promoted from Director of Marketing and Media to Chief Marketing Officer; and
* Niclas Hedhman will be promoted from Director of FinTech to Chief Technology Officer.

"We’re growing and scaling up to handle the volume of activity around Subutai, particularly as the Subutai Blockchain Router is in production which has sparked demand by several telecommunications providers," said Alex Karasulu, Founder and Co-CEO of OptDyn. "With these leadership changes we are better poised to handle the increase in development, sales, and production."

Mr. Karasulu is the original creator of the Apache Directory project, and has mentored numerous incubating Apache projects and their communities as a long-time Member of the Apache Software Foundation. His software powers Fortune 50 solutions and is used in products by Atlassian, Cisco, Google, IBM, and Polycom, among many others.

Mr. Hall is widely recognized for his tireless evangelism and education of the benefits of Free and Open Source Software and Hardware, most notably alongside Linux creator Linus Torvalds and as Board Chair of the Linux Professional Institute.

Ms. Khudairi is the former deputy to World Wide Web inventor Sir Tim Berners-Lee as Head of Communications at W3C, and helped launch the Apache Software Foundation, where she was elected its first female and first non-technical Member, and currently serves as officer and Vice President.

Mr. Hedhman is former Vice President for Equity Risk Technology and Enterprise Application Infrastructure at Morgan Stanley, and has consulted for eWarna.com, Lufthansa, Sony-Ericsson, and Ventyx ABB, among others. He has been contributing to Open Source for over two decades and is heavily involved in the Apache Software Foundation.
