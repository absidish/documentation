“We are excited to expand our Cloud and IoT offerings with the Subutai platform,” said Professor João Antonio Zuffo, president of LSITEC. “Our partnership with OptDyn strengthens our leadership in helping bring emerging technological innovations to the industry-at-large. Subutai is truly a game-changer.”

LSITEC is among OptDyn’s many Latin American partners that include Project Cauã, the Open Source software and hardware program to create millions of new high-tech jobs in Brazil and Latin America.

“We are proud to bring personal Cloud computing and IoT to the community with the first Subutai Routers made in Latin America, and look forward to collaborating with many distinguished partners in Latin America,” added Hall.
