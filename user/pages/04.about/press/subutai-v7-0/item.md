##OptDyn™ Unleashes Subutai™ v.7.0 {.postTitle-page}

**Breakthrough Peer-to-Peer Cloud Computing IaaS software used in Mission-Critical FinTech, ISP, and Industrial Internet of Things Applications, among many others.**

**New Castle, DE — 10 May 2018 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) —** OptDyn™, makers of Subutai™, the world’s first intelligent blockchain-driven, Peer-to-Peer Cloud and IoT computing platform, today announced the release of Subutai 7.0.

Subutai disrupts, decentralizes, and commoditizes Cloud Computing and the Internet of Things (IoT), allowing users to easily participate in a cryptocurrency sharing economy through energy-efficient cryptocurrency mining and renting of idle computing resources on the edge. Subutai originated as a multi-million dollar advanced defense research contract for a new P2P Cloud computing platform that could reconfigure itself dynamically and securely across the Internet. In 2013, after the client allowed the core technology to be open sourced, OptDyn was founded to bring Subutai to the world. The Subutai ecosystem consists of:

* Subutai PeerOS — Open Source, container-based P2P Cloud and IoT software;
* Subutai Bazaar — a marketplace to buy/sell computing resources and applications. Bazaar Blueprints instantly stand up common open source applications like MatterMost and the Subutai Blockchain-in-a-Box blueprint;
* Subutai Blockchain Router — a power-efficient “green” broadband Cloud router and IoT gateway that serves as a plug-and-play cryptocurrency wallet and mining device. Subutai Blockchain Router v2.0 is currently in production, with delivery Q3 2018; and
* KHAN™ —an Ethereum Blockchain-based reserve currency token the ubiquitous currency across the Subutai Platform. Launching 2018.

"Subutai 7 is production ready with several new features to bring P2P cloud computing to the masses," said Alex Karasulu, CTO and Founder of OptDyn. "We are continually improving Subutai's functionality, scalability, and usability to realize our long range vision and support future user demands. Subutai 7 unlocks years of development to the platform's infrastructure, making it an essential upgrade for individual and commercial users to instantly conquer the cloud."

Major updates, enhancements, and dozens of bug fixes make Subutai v7.0 faster, more efficient, and easier to use. Highlights include:

* Bazaar and Control-Center usability improvements;
* Blockchain Smart Contracts for Service Level Agreements;
* P2P fast-warm up and other performance improvements;
* Default CoW (copy-on-write) file system uses ZFS;
* Standard Debian Packaging; and template versioning;
* Numerous stability improvements and bug fixes.

A comprehensive list of new features can be found in the release notes at [https://subutai.blog/2018/05/10/the-horde-is-coming-subutai-7-0/](https://subutai.blog/2018/05/10/the-horde-is-coming-subutai-7-0/)

As Open Source software, Subutai is available 100% free-of-charge. Subutai's 29 repositories are available for download from [https://github.com/subutai-io](https://github.com/subutai-io). Users are invited to get started at [https://subutai.io/getting-started.html](https://subutai.io/getting-started.html).

**Democratizing the Cloud**

Up to 90% of computing resources are unused at any time. Subutai lets anyone sell or rent their unused computer resources to create clouds on the edge, as opposed to centralized locations. Subutai's Open Source, container-based, dynamic P2P multi-cloud performs in a similar manner to Amazon's Virtual Private Cloud, but runs on users' own computers as well as those with whom they share and rent compute resources. Karasulu envisioned this as the "people's cloud", with available devices securely attaching to clouds closer to them on the edge. In addition to actual computers, edge devices comprise a variety of connected "things", such as "smart home" electronics, appliances, sensors, intelligent digital assistants, vehicles, and countless other devices that access and exchange data, all of which fall under the umbrella of the Internet of Things (IoT). This also applies to FinTech, Industrial IoT, Industry 4.0, and many other applications that are self-optimizing, self-configuring, and responsive to real-time low latency communications, analytics, and insights.

Subutai powers collaborative consumption: the same disruptive forces Airbnb used with rental homes now apply to the Cloud and IoT. Many commonly refer to it as a sharing economy. Anyone can buy and sell resources from anyone else. Subutai, like Airbnb, connects those selling resources with those running applications needing the resources. It is an on-demand sharing economy that gives everyone access without having to worry about changes being made without either party's knowledge.

By allowing individuals and commercial entities of any size to to participate in a cloud services sharing economy —democratizing the cloud— the "race to zero" rapidly accelerates to reduce costs and increase hosting options closer to, or on, the edge. This has the additional advantage of increasing performance and efficiency by locating services and applications closer to where those services and applications are used most.

Subutai offers a secure, flexible, and rich ecosystem to accommodate a variety of users:

**From hobbyists...**

"Subutai is a very exciting platform," said Neil Spink, a senior Agile developer for one of the world's largest insurance providers and host of the Cloud computing resource site [https://www.clouded.ch/](https://www.clouded.ch/). "Setting up your own dynamic cloud between your home devices is just the beginning. I predict exponential growth of this platform in the near future, with interesting uses: image processing, blockchain, Internet of Things, data analysis, and so on. There are infinite possibilities for Subutai."

Spink is using Subutai as a Minecraft game server for his 11-year-old son and his friends. "There's a symbiosis for gamers, who I think would also like this platform and if we're all sharing and bartering using the GoodWill credits, this is going to be fantastic," added Spink. He also developed the blueprint for the Minio Open Source object storage server during the Subutai Blueprint Hackathon.

**To mission-critical applications...**

OptDyn recently entered a strategic Memorandum of Understanding with Celtab/PTI to power mission-critical Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) programs in Brazil. Celtab is one of the research centers of Brazil's Itaipu Technological Park, the foundation responsible for promoting scientific, technological, and innovation development linked to Itaipu Binacional, the largest clean energy generator in the world. Celtab performs open software research aiming at innovation and the generation of solutions to meet Itaipu's needs.

"What interests us is the American entrepreneurship logic. From OptDyn, mainly, we expect to transform business starting from open technologies," said Claudio Issamy Osako, PTI Technical Director. "This MoU will give us the possibility to apply Subutai hardware and software technology to develop solutions in many areas... If you develop real solutions for real problems, you develop a market, entrepreneurships, companies...from this MoU, we'll optimize IoT projects and that's huge for us."

"Subutai is proven, mature, and is in use today," added Karasulu. "The many ways our users depend on Subutai to meet their everyday needs is inspiring. We are committed to driving innovation that is valuable and accessible to everyone, and are excited to welcome new developers and users to the horde."
