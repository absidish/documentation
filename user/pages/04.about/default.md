</div>

Subutai originated as a multi-million dollar defense project for a new P2P Cloud computing platform that could reconfigure itself dynamically and securely across the Internet. After the project was completed, the client allowed the software to be open sourced. In 2013 OptDyn was formed to make this software available to everybody.

Our Open Source roots run deep, with more than 100 years’ recognized technical and community leadership. We are committed to mentoring our global team of developers, engineers, designers, QA specialists, project managers, and others “The Apache Way”. Our passion for P2P Cloud computing and *NIX operating systems extend to our products, where we strive to improve the P2P Cloud computing, Internet of Things, and cryptocurrency mining experience for everyone. OptDyn is based in the United States with distributed teams in Europe, Asia, and South America.
