### Use Case: Be Your Own Micro Cloud Provider

[TOC]

By using P2P technologies to combine resources on computers, Subutai already provides an infrastructure as a service cloud environment. Subutai users can create cloud environments effectively appearing as virtual data centers. The more computing resources you throw into your peer[s] and the number of peers supporting your environment, the bigger the virtual data center. Scaling a peer with more resources and scaling the number of peers themselves give Subutai its elastic cloud capabilities. Higher level infrastructure services are built on this such as an S3 compatible clone. Subutai aims to model and implement as many Amazon compatible services as possible.

### Use Case: Virtual Office

We're very excited about building applications that can run across P2P cloud infrastructures for distributed startup teams and SME's with multiple branch offices. Not only do you tie people and SOHO offices together, but you enable them with common back-office and productivity applications they need. Native built-in social cloud services can be utilized to quickly build your ultimate application on Subutai.

### Use Case: Virtual Electronics and IoT Laboratory

We love electronics and writing applications for gadgets on the edge. The only problem is having instant access to them or the tools for working with them. We've envisioned using Subutai to set up virtual laboratories where these devices and various tools could be shared to increase the rate of development of software and hardware. We think such a system could especially benefit those students in universities and talented entrepreneurs around the world that lack budgets to have everything on hand.

### Use Case: Last Mile Communications

There are a lot of communities that live “on the edge”. They are not served well by cloud providers because they are too far or too small for the large companies to serve them well with good Internet services and high speeds. Some of these communities have started using Open Source solutions to provide their own communications using long range WiFi, and wireless mesh technologies and local servers. However using a centralized cloud model means that much of their data has to travel outside of the community to the centralized cloud taxing the bandwidth of the backbone connection to the Internet, driving up their communication costs and increasing the latency of their Internet responses. Despite the “world-wide” aspects of the “World-Wide-Web”, a lot of the data and communications are done very locally.
Subutai can give local people control of their cloud usage, allowing them to cache data locally in community clouds and execute applications on the edge, with Subutai’s intelligent management services making automatic decisions on where to execute programs and store data, decreasing the amount of systems administration overhead and making management easier.

Subutai’s blueprints allow for local applications or application suites to be developed, suitable for the local community. Other types of high-bandwidth, low-latency applications would also work better in community clouds with relatively local servers such as VoIP and IP video conferencing.

### Use Case: The Home Environment - better security, better performance

The message of the large cloud providers is to keep all of your data on their servers, whether it be your music, your pictures, your videos or anything else that you want to store. Their promise is that they can keep it more with greater security and give you access to it all over the world. They will protect your data from people breaking in, back-up your data in case of fire or physical theft.

One of the issues with the large cloud providers has to do with the speed of the Internet connection required to meet the needs of streaming videos and music, combined with the recurring costs of pulling the data across your Internet provider every time you access it.

One way of solving that is to store (or “cache”) much of your data locally, and use the big cloud provider as a backup in case of physical disaster. Setting up such a local server does take a little time, but can often be made easier by using a router that allows you to attach a disk drive to the router. Many commercially available routers allow this to be done with a simple USB drive. They also allow local attachment of other USB devices.

These devices typically do not provide RAID capabilities. This means that if one disk fails, you lose the local data and you then have to access it from the cloud provider until you can get the disk fixed and the data downloaded again. Another problem is with the cost of long-term storage for your backed-up data and the security of your home server.

The Subutai Blockchain Router provides RAID protection for the disk storage, allowing up to two of the disks in the system to fail and still receive the data. The Subutai Blockchain Router also provides a secure gateway to protect your data from the Internet. A special processor uses state-of-the-art security software plus scans incoming and outgoing data packets for viruses in real time as well as monitoring the operating system for anomalies.

Backups can be arranged by having an associate or family member who you trust and who is physically separate from you (far enough that fire, flood and other natural disasters are not an issue) who also has a Subutai installed or has a Blockchair Router (or some other appropriate router) and store a copy of your files encrypted on that router. If a disaster occurs you can take your router to the site of the backup system and quickly restore your files from their system. Note that this type of backup is more for disaster and not for accidentally removing a set of files. For that an incremental backup plan is useful, but could still be accomplished the same way.

Having this local cache on disk inside your home or business means that “accessing your cloud” happens a great deal faster and with less expense than normal Internet speeds allow. When you go outside your business Subutai Open Source Peer-to-Peer Cloud Software allows you to access your data as if you were still at home, and approximately the same speeds as you would from “the big cloud provider”.

### Use Case: Carriers of the cloud

The telecommunications industry continues to change over the years. What was first telephone sending analog voice over copper wires with digital data shoehorned on top now is digital streams of data (either copper, fibre or radio) with Voice Over the Internet Protocol (VoIP) seamlessly integrated. In the fledgling days of the Internet it was “Internet Service Providers” (ISPs) who provided the services (email, data storage, web hosting) over the communications links of the local carriers. The Internet was built to be resilient to outages by various local problems such as floods, hurricanes, civil strife, etc.
Big cloud companies changed that. While a lot of facilities may still be provided by the local carriers, more and more services are offered by mostly centralized services, and while the big cloud companies are careful to have redundancy that helps to isolate from natural disasters, the fact that they are owned by a large company means that they have some major issues:

- The customer can not be sure of where their data is kept or their > programs are run
- The customer can not easily integrate services between major > companies
- The customer often suffers from “lock in”

The “telcos” (whether a traditional telephone company, cable company or cell phone operator) are locked out of providing similar services as the large cloud companies to their customers without a massive investment in software that is standard across telco vendors. Only software that is standard will generate enough of a base of customers to attract developers and clients.

Enter Subuai. Since Subutai is Open Source it can be used as a cloud solution by any carrier. Due to Subutai’s licensing and portability telcos can offer peer-to-peer cloud solutions to all of their customers without even having to ask OptDyn’s permission. By licensing and re-branding the Subutai Bazaar carriers can offer other “cloud” services and products to their clients using smart contracts, and under their own brand. The Bazaar, however, can also be distributed and federated, giving their customers access to the widest number of applications and resources.

Finally, the Subutai Blockchain Router is an Open Hardware broadband router, RAID-based NAS server, and IoT gateway that can also do cryptocurrency mining and offers a hardware wallet for the account keys. Performance experiments indicate that the customer may generate enough cryptocurrency to pay for their telecommunications costs every month without seeing any change in their power consumption over a standard broadband router. This will be a market changer for telcos, and of course the router can be rebranded by the provider.

### Use Case: Energy savings through IoT

Almost everyone loves green energy. Unfortunately from time to time the energy demand goes above the energy supply of hydro electric plants, solar farms, and other low-polluting sources. Hot summers, with lots of air conditioning, cooling demands for food, and more and more demands on electricity have forced electric companies to direct their customers to using more efficient electric products and during off-peak hours.
Many people are using home and business automation to reduced their consumption of electricity by reducing lighting to “need to have” (turning lights on and off automatically), and scheduling heavy use of electricity to off-peak. Electric companies not only want to help their customers save electricity, but they want to carefully monitor power usage to determine other ways of helping save electricity during peak hours. Many electric companies are doing a lot of research in reducing power consumption.

IoT enters into this, but power companies fear IoT due to the possibility of viruses and Denial of Service (DoS) attacks getting into the power grid through the “things”, and having massive amounts of “things” affect other parts of the grid. Customers fear the use of IoT controlling their homes.

The Subutai™ Blockchain Router uses sophisticated technology for examining every data packet that passes through the system, either from the outside grid and telecommunication lines to the “things” inside the home or business, or from the “things” going back to the outside, for viruses and other malware. The Blockchain Router also constantly examines the operating system for anomalies in operation to determine if the operating system itself has become infected. A Dynamic Information Flow Tracking (DIFT) coprocessor in the router’s FPGA is being designed to inspect router instructions in realtime to trap malicious code. Therefore power companies have a much better assurance of using data from homes and businesses when using the Subutai Blockchain Router.

### Use Case: Banks

Banks also have large data centers where sensitive data is stored, and they need strong encryption and authentication. Banks use ATM machines, which in many ways resembles the “Things” of the Internet of Things. Banks either need very private networks (expensive to create) or very strong virtual private networks which require very strong encryption and very good authentication. Subutai provides both, and (being Open Source) gives banks the ability to audit the code to make sure that there are no trap doors or other malware in it.

When portable calculators first came out they were very expensive. As the price dropped banks used calculators to “reward” depositors that opened up new accounts. Over the years these “rewards” included toasters and other incentives. Imagine how great the incentive would be for customers to open a new account if they received a Subutai Blockchain Router for opening a new account … a router that could mine cryptocurrency. The bank could brand the router and cryptocurrency with their own brand, and start their own blockchain economy inside their country.
