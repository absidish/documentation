We have a number of ways to help you get started or to find technical support:
* The topics in this [user documentation](https://github.com/MarilizaC/doc_v2/wiki/Introduction#about-this-subutai-documentation) provide instructions and guidelines on how to use the Subutai features and components. The more technical users or developers may find helpful information from the [GitHub wiki pages](https://github.com/subutai-io/). 
* Our team and users hang out at [Subutai Slack](https://slack.subutai.io/) and [Telegram](https://t.me/SubutaiKHAN). You can find skilled developers and users who will assist with your technical issues. You may also get tips and best practices when using any of the Subutai products.
