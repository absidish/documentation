#### <a name="preferences-notifications"></a> Preferences on Notifications

On the Notifications history screen, you can set your view preference:

* **Default view** - When the **Full info** box is not checked, the table displays the instance count, notification level, message, and Ignore option. 	  
![Default view](cc-defaultview.png)    
Under the Ignore column, check the **true** or **false** box next to a message to hide or display it, respectively. Notifications remain on display for seven days and are automatically removed after this period. You may still access notification logs from the storage folder. 
* **Full info view** - When you check the Full info box, the date, notification level, and message are displayed.
