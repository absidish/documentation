Monitor your components through charts and graphs generated from real-time data. Performance metrics are provided for the CPU, network, memory, and disk of a component.

Use the filters on each tab to select the specific component that you want to view.

* **Peer**    
  On the Peer tab, select the host and period.

  The current P2P status is also displayed beside the filters.

* **Environment**   
  On the Environment tab, select the environment, container, and period.

* **Management**   
  On the Management tab, select a period.

Hover over a graph or chart to view actual figures. The following images are from Peer metrics:

* **CPU** - percentage of usage for system and user
* **Network** - incoming (in) and outgoing (out) data transmission metrics
* **Memory** - cache and other RAM metrics
* **Disk** - used and total disk space (in GB), with breakdown of usage per directory
