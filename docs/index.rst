Subutai Documentation
=====================

According to several studies, 98% of personal computer resources run idle.
Another study showed 94% of EC2 instance resources in AWS run idle while
96% on self hosted servers run idle in company data centers. Regardless of 
the slight differences, when you add all this up globally, one can reasonably 
conclude that a massive amount of computer resources needlessly perish 
every day.

Subutai puts these resources to good use by allowing unused resources to be 
shared by or rented to others. Computers swarm together to create secure 
peer-to-peer (P2P) virtual private networks (VPN). These virtual networks 
are overlay networks on top of existing networks. The VPN has its own subnet
with an IP address range just like your network at home. Computers swarming 
to create this VPN package and expose unused resources (CPU, RAM, and DISK) 
as Linux Container hosts inside the VPN with IP addresses in the VPN's subnet.
Regardless of where the containers are located they look and feel like they
are connected to one physical switch. The swarm creates a virtual private 
cloud environment, a kind of virtual data center, with a network and hosts 
on which software stacks can be installed. Infrastructure and applications 
thus run indefinitely within these virtual private cloud environment using
idle computer resources.

Subutai groups machines and devices on the same local area network (LAN) into
a Subutai Peer. The peer offers resources and devices to construct virtual 
private cloud environments. Environments can shift across different peers to
satisify their need to gain more or different kinds of resources. Sometimes
peer selection is driven by location: services may be broght closer to a 
cluster of users to increase the response time of applications running 
within the environment. The peers participating in an environment swarm 
fluidly join and leave the swarm over time and as conditions change. This 
results in dynamic environments that can change shape or move around on the
edge, in the cloud, or in self hosted corporate data centers or closets.

By operating on the edge, where most devices reside, private cloud environments
have the opportunity to directly interact with devices. Meteorologists refer to
clouds in contact with land as fog. Cisco used this to coin the term fog 
computing. Fog computing involves the incorporation of these devices on the 
edge into larger computing systems. The aim is to use sensors and actuators 
on the edge to build systems that can sense and respond to physical conditions.
This is the whole point to the Internet of Things. Subutai's decentralization
and fluity philosophy turns everything upside down in a good way.

The Internet of Things (IoT) referring to billions of devices 
connected to the Internet, was also referred to as 


is also sometimes referred to as fog computing.

On the edge, where most devices reside, the private cloud environment can 
directly interact with devices. The advantages of operating on the edge are
an integral shift  

If we had to give some short technical description of Subutai, we would 
refer to it as a P2P Cloud Computing and IoT platform.

Subutai is a peer-to-peer (p2p) cloud computing and Internet of Things (IoT) 
platform. Subutai Peers are a grouping of computers and devices on the same
local network: they're close to each other. Like a flock of birds, Subutai 
Peers swarm together to create a virtual private network and expose resources
as hosts with ip addresses in this network's subnet.

that allows anyone to rent or share computer resources and devices 
with others to create dynamic virtual private cloud environments spanning 
across the Internet.

Subutai Clouds run applications using resources and devices contributed by
peers participating in private authorized swarms. Swarm members come and go
as conditions change and the cloud reacts to meet the needs of its owner to
satisfy constraints and maintain a desired state. Subutai clouds thus move
and change shape like an ameoba across peers on the Internet.

A Subutai Peer is a grouping of computers and devices on the same local area 
network. If a peer authorized by cloud rules, can offer a cloud environment its computer
resources or devices. Peers offers these resources using Linux Containers.

lets anyone share, or rent computer resources (even commercially) to

them (that's the Internet of Things part). 

In a nutshell, we simply call it 
"Social Cloud Computing". We think this is totally badassed mind explosion inducing madness: that's why we named it after a badassed general. Plus we think this is going to conquer the world and want you to join us in the "`War Room <https://hub.subut.ai>`_" to help lead the campaign.

We've been coding up a storm using every advantage we can gain from the latest emerging technologies to make the jaw dropping magic happen. We're shocked and get goose bumps every time we see it working ourselves; we fire up our own clouds across developer machines because we just CAN. It's sick! Now it's time for us to share the magic with everyone else.

Welcome to the Peer-to-Peer Social Cloud Computing Revolution!
