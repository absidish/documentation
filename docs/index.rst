Subutai and Hub User Guide
==========================

Subutai Social lets anyone share socially, or rent computers commercially to create cloud environments while attaching whatever devices are around to them (that's the Internet of Things part). In a nutshell, we simply call it "Social Cloud Computing". We think this is totally badassed mind explosion inducing madness: that's why we named it after a badassed general. Plus we think this is going to conquer the world and want you to join us in the "`War Room <https://hub.subut.ai>`_" to help lead the campaign.

We've been coding up a storm using every advantage we can gain from the latest emerging technologies to make the jaw dropping magic happen. We're shocked and get goose bumps every time we see it working ourselves; we fire up our own clouds across developer machines because we just CAN. It's sick! Now it's time for us to share the magic with everyone else.

Welcome to the Peer-to-Peer Social Cloud Computing Revolution!
