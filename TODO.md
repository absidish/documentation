Things to do
============

- figure out the organization and how this will all work with wiki markdown and rst
  - we will pull in wiki markdown pages and this will be how community will work via GitHub
  - might need some scripts to organize the markdown and include it in the toctree of rst
  - someone still needs to figure out how a wiki page fits into the toctree
  - maybe we need just alerts so someone can look at this or we use some embedded cues to
    an automated system to figure out how to place the new markdown document?
  - document these ideas and ask for help, can't figure this out alone
- how do we integrate our materials on google docs?

Documentation Sources
---------------------

How do we pull in all these materials? What's the authoritative source of docs?

- GitHub Wiki - Primary Technical
- Google Docs - Guides and Other Supporting User Guide Materials
- Other - Some information is siloed in the main website's html pages
