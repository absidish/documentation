You can add user variables for your Blueprint in this menu. For
instance, you can add your Environment’s name and then, when someone
builds an Environment with the Blueprint, this variable will be
automatically added. This option is useful, because you don’t need to
specify some variables before creating environment (e.g. pre-configure
its name).
