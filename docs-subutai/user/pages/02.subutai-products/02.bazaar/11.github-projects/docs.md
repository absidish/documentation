The GitHub projects menu allows you to add your GitHub projects to the Subutai Bazaar Apps section. You can for instance create your own Blueprint in GitHub, then authorize it on the Subutai Bazaar and upload it. After that, users will be able to build Environments based on your Blueprint. You can also publish your blueprint in the Apps section.
