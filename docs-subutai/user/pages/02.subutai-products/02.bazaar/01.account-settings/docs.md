When the user clicks their name in the right top corner of the Subutai Bazaar, a pop up menu shows up. In this menu there is a Gear-like button. After clicking this button, the user can see their account settings:

*    User name
*    E-mail, which was used while signing up.
*    Country of location.
*    User guides (hints). Here the user can switch off the user hints in every Bazaar page. Disable it if it annoys you too much ;)
*    Reset user guides. Here you you can reset all completed user guides (if you do that,you will see all user guides again).
*    Change password. You need to know your old password to create a new one.
*    PGP fingerprint (Pretty Good Privacy) is a special sort of encryption. PGP increases the security of communications between the user’s machine and servers. You can change it if you need at any time. PGP key is generated automatically by the browser [E2E plugin](../../companion-software/e2e-plugin).
*    Here also you can delete your account, if you don’t need it anymore. Beware: this operation is permanent.
