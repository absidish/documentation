You can add user variables for your Blueprint in this menu. For instance, you can add your Environment’s name and then, when someone builds an Environment with the Blueprint, this variable will be automatically added. This option is useful, because you don’t need to specify some variables before creating environment (e.g. pre-configure its name).
