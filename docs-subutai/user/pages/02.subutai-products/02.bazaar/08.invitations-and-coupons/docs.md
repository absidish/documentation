**Invitations** - It is possible to invite new users by email to join the Subutai Bazaar. Once you send an invitation by email, the user will receive a link and be directed to the Bazarâ€™s registration page. Note that this link expires within 1 hour. When the user is registered, both of you receive an award in GoodWill.

**Coupons** - We often partner up with different organizations to offer particular coupon codes.You can take the code, go to User Profile -> Coupon and enter the coupon code in this field. For this we will award you with some GoodWill.
